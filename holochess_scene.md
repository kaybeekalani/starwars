**[HAN]** Anyway, we should be at Alderaan
about oh-two-hundred hours.

**[THREEPIO]** Now be careful, Artoo.

**[THREEPIO]** He made a fair move. Screaming about
it won't help you.

**[HAN]** (interrupting)
Let him have it. It's not wise to
upset a Wookiee.

**[THREEPIO]** But sir, nobody worries about
upsetting a droid.

**[HAN]** That's 'cause droids don't pull
people's arms out of their socket
when they lose. Wookiees are known
to do that.

**[THREEPIO]** I see your point, sir. I suggest a
new strategy, Artoo. Let the Wookiee
win.
